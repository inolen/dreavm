   * there are 32 32-bit floating point registers, fr0-fr15 and xf0-xf15. these
   * registers are banked, and swapped with eachother when the bank bit of
   * FPSCR changes. in addition, fr0â€“fr15 can be used as the eight registers
   * dr0/2/4/6/8/10/12/14 (double-precision, or pair registers) or the four
   * registers fv0/4/8/12 (vector registers). while xf0-xf15 can be used as
   * the eight registers xd0/2/4/6/8/10/12/14 (pair registers) or register
   * matrix XMTRX
   *
   * note, the sh4 does not support endian conversion for 64-bit data.
   * therefore, if 64-bit floating point access is performed in little endian
   * mode, the upper and lower 32 bits will be reversed. for example, dr2
   * aliases fr2 and fr3, but fr3 is actually the low-order word
   *
   * in order to avoid swapping the words in every double-precision opcode, the
   * mapping for each pair of single-precision registers is instead swapped by
   * XOR'ing the actual index with 1. for example, fr2 becomes fr[3] and fr3
   * becomes fr[2], enabling dr2 to perfectly alias fr[2]

   * note note, this incorrectly causes fv registers to be swizzled. fv0 should
   * be loaded as {fr0, fr1, fr2, fr3} but it's actually loaded as
   * {fr1, fr0, fr3, fr2}. however, due to the way the FV registers are
   * used (FIPR and FTRV) this doesn't actually affect the results
